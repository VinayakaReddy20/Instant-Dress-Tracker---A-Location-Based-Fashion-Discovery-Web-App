## About The Project

### Problem Statement

In the current retail environment, customers face significant challenges when searching for specific clothing items in physical stores. This process is often time-consuming and inefficient due to a lack of visibility into shop inventories. Shoppers waste time visiting multiple locations only to find that a desired dress is out of stock or unavailable in their size or preferred color.

### Our Solution

**Instant Dress Tracker** is an innovative web platform designed to eliminate this friction. It offers customers real-time visibility into the live inventory of local clothing shops. Our system allows users to search for specific dresses or browse the collections of nearby stores from the comfort of their homes, ensuring they only visit a store when they know their desired item is available.

By bridging the information gap between retailers and consumers, our solution streamlines the shopping experience, saves valuable time, and enhances decision-making for fashion-conscious buyers.
